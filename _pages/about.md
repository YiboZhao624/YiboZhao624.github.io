<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a second-year post-graduate Student at the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) in the PLANING (graPh mining and LANguage processING) lab.

My research interests include:
- **Large Language Models**: applications in GraphRAG, toxicity detection, and detoxification.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: applications in agent related research, especially tool calling and memory management.

★★★ Feel free to reach out to me for academic discussions and collaborations!
